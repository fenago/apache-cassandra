Lab 3. CQL Data Types
----------------------------------


In this lab, we will have an overview of Cassandra Query Language
and take a detailed look into the wealthy set of data types supported by
Cassandra. We will walk through the data types to study what their
internal storage structure looks like.

Introduction to CQL
-------------------------------------

Cassandra introduced Cassandra Query Language (CQL) in release 0.8 as a
SQL-like alternative to the traditional Thrift RPC
API. As of the time of this writing, the latest CQL version is 3.1.7. I
do not want to take you through all of its old versions and therefore, I
will focus on version 3.1.7 only. It should be noted that CQL Version 3
is not backward compatible with CQL Version 2 and differs from it in
many ways.



### CQL statements


CQL Version 3 provides a model very similar to SQL. Conceptually, it
uses a table to store data in rows of columns. It
is composed of three main types of statements:


-   **Data definition statements**: These 
    are used to set and change how data
    is stored in Cassandra

-   **Data manipulation statements**: These 
    are used to create, delete, and modify data

-   **Query statements**: These are used
    to look up data

CQL is case insensitive, unless the word is enclosed in double quotation
marks. It defines a list of keywords that have a fixed meaning for the
language. It distinguishes between reserved and 
non-reserved keywords. **Reserved** keywords
cannot be used as identifiers. They are
truly reserved for the language.
**Non-reserved** keywords only have a 
specific meaning in certain contexts but can be used as
identifiers. The list of CQL keywords is shown in DataStax's
 documentation at
<http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_reference/keywords_r.html>.


### CQL command-line client -- cqlsh


Cassandra bundles an interactive terminal
supporting CQL, known as `cqlsh`. It is  a
Python-based command-line client used to run CQL commands. To start
`cqlsh` , navigate to Cassandra's `bin` directory
and type the following:


-   On Linux, type `./cqlsh`

-   On Windows, type `cqlsh.bat` or `python cqlsh`

As shown in the following figure, `cqlsh` shows the cluster
name, Cassandra, CQL, and Thrift protocol versions on startup:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_01.jpg)

:::
cqlsh connected to the Cassandra instance running on the local node
:::

We can use `cqlsh` to connect to other nodes by appending the
host (either hostname or IP address) and port as command-line
parameters.

If we want to create a keyspace called `fenago` using
`SimpleStrategy` (which will be explained in,
*Enhancing a Version*) as its replication strategy and
setting the replication factor as one for a single-node Cassandra
cluster, we can type the CQL statement, shown in the following
screenshot, in `cqlsh`.

This utility will be used extensively in this course to demonstrate how to
use CQL to define the Cassandra data model:

:::

### Native data types

CQL Version 3 supports many basic data types for
columns. It also supports collection types and all data types available
to Cassandra. The following table lists the supported basic data types
and their corresponding meanings:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/table1.png)

### Cassandra implementation


If we look into the Cassandra's Java source code,
the CQL Version 3 native data types are declared in
an `enum` called `Native` in the
`org.apache.cassandra.cql3.CQL3Type` interface, as shown in
the following screenshot:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_03.jpg)

:::
Cassandra source code declaring CQL Version 3 native data types
:::

It is interesting to know that `TEXT` and
`VARCHAR` are indeed both
`UTF8Type`. The Java classes of `AsciiType` ,
`LongType` , `BytesType` , `DecimalType` ,
and so on are declared in the
`org.apache.cassandra.db.marshal` package.


### Note

Cassandra source code is available on GitHub at
<https://github.com/apache/cassandra>.

Knowing the Java implementation of the native data types allows us to
have a deeper understanding of how Cassandra handles them. For example,
Cassandra uses the
`org.apache.cassandra.serializers.InetAddressSerializer` class
and `java.net.InetAddress` class to handle the
serialization/deserialization of the `INET` data type.


### A not-so-long example


These native data types are used in CQL statements
to specify the type of data to be stored in a column of a table. Now let
us create an experimental table with columns of each native data type
(except counter type since it requires a separate table), and then
insert some data into it. We need to specify the keyspace,
`fenago` in this example, before creating the table called
`table01` , as shown in the following screenshot:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_04.jpg)

:::
Create table01 to illustrate each native data type
:::

We create the table using the default values, but, there are other
options to configure the new table for optimizations, including
compaction, compression, failure handling, and so on. The
`PRIMARY KEY` clause, which is on only one column, could also
be specified along with an attribute, that is,
`rowkey ascii PRIMARY KEY`. Then insert a sample record into
`table01`. We make it with an `INSERT` statement, as
shown in the following screenshot:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_05.jpg)

:::
Insert a sample record into table01
:::

We now have data inside `table01`. We use
`cqlsh` to query the table. For the sake of comparison, we
also use another Cassandra command-line tool called Cassandra CLI to
have a low-level view of the row. Let us open Cassandra CLI on a
terminal.


### Note

**Cassandra CLI utility**

Cassandra CLI is used to set storage configuration
attributes on a per-keyspace or per-table basis. To start it up, you
navigate to Cassandra bin directory and type the following:


-   On Linux, `./cassandra-cli`

-   On Windows, `cassandra.bat`
:::

Note that it was announced to be deprecated in Cassandra 3.0 and
`cqlsh` should be used instead.

The results of the `SELECT` statement in `cqlsh` and
the `list` command in Cassandra CLI are shown in the following
screenshot. We will then walk through each column one by one:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_06.jpg)

:::
Comparison of the sample row in cqlsh and Cassandra CLI
:::


### ASCII


Internally, a data value `'ABC'` is
stored as the byte values in hexadecimal
representation of each individual character, `'A'` ,
`'B'` , and `'C'` as `0x41` ,
`0x42` , and `0x43` respectively.


### Bigint


This  is simple; the
hexadecimal representation of the number `1000000000` is
`0x000000003b9aca00` of 64-bit length stored internally.


### BLOB


A `BLOB` data type is used to store a
large binary object. In our previous example, we
inserted a text `'ABC'` as a `BLOB` into the
`blobfield`. The internal representation is
`414243` , which is just a stream of bytes in hexadecimal
representation.

Obviously, a `BLOB` field can accept all kinds of data, and
because of this flexibility it cannot have validation on its data value.
For example, a data value `2` may be interpreted as either an
integer `2` or a text `'2'`. Without knowing the
interpretation we want, a `BLOB` field can impose a check on
the data value.

Another interesting point of a `BLOB` field is that, as shown
in the `SELECT` statement in the previous screenshot in
`cqlsh` , the data value of `blobfield` returned is
`0x414243` for `'ABC'` text. We know from the
previous section that `0x41` , `0x42` ,
`0x43` are the byte values of `'A'` ,
`'B'` , and `'C'` , respectively. However, for a
`BLOB` field, `cqlsh` prefixes its data value with
`'0x'` to make it a so-called BLOB constant. A BLOB constant
is a sequence of bytes in their hexadecimal values prefixed by
`0[xX](hex)+` where `hex` is a hexadecimal
character, such as `[0-9a-fA-F]`.

CQL also provides a number of `BLOB` conversion functions to
convert native data types into a `BLOB` and vice versa. For
every `<native-type>` (except `BLOB` for an obvious
reason) supported by CQL, the `<native-type>AsBlob` function
takes an argument of type `<native-type>` and returns it as a
`BLOB`. Contrarily, the `blobAs<Native-type>`
function reverses the conversion from a `BLOB` back to a
`<native-type>`. As demonstrated in the `INSERT`
statement, we have used `textAsBlob()` to convert a
`text` data type into a `BLOB`.


### Note

**BLOB constant**

BLOB constants were introduced in CQL version 3.0.2 to allow users to
input `BLOB` values. In older versions of
CQL, inputting `BLOB` as string was
supported for convenience. It is now deprecated and
will be removed in a future version. It is still supported only to allow
smoother transition to a `BLOB` constant. Updating the client
code to switch to `BLOB` constants should be done as soon as
possible.


### Boolean


A `boolean` data type is also very
intuitive. It is merely a single byte of either
`0x00` , which means `False` , or `0x01` ,
which means `True` , in the internal storage.


### Decimal


A `decimal` data type can store a
variable-precision decimal, basically a
`BigDecimal` data type in Java.


### Double


The `double` data type is a
double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point in
its internal storage.


### Float


The `float` data type is a
single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point in
its internal storage.


### Note

**BigDecimal, double, or float?**

The difference between `double` and
`float` is obviously the length of
precision in the floating point value. Both `double` and
`float` use binary representation of decimal numbers with a
radix which is in many cases an approximation, not an absolute value.
`double `is a 64-bit value while `float` is an even
shorter 32-bit value. Therefore, we can say that double is more precise
than float. However, in both cases, there is still a possibility of loss
of precision which can be very noticeable when working with either very
big numbers or very small numbers.

On the contrary, `BigDecimal` is devised to overcome this loss
of precision discrepancy. It is an exact way of representing numbers.
Its disadvantage is slower runtime performance.

Whenever you are dealing with money or
precision is a must, `BigDecimal` is the
best choice (or `decimal` in CQL native data types), otherwise
`double` or `float` should be
good enough.


### Inet


The `inet` data type is designed for
storing IP address values in **IP Version 4**
(**IPv4**) and **IP Version 6**
(**IPv6**) format. The IP address, `192.168.0.1` ,
in the example record is stored as four bytes
internally; `192` is  stored as
`0xc0` , `168` as `0xa8` , `0` as
`0x00` , and `1` as `0x01` , respectively.
It should be noted that regardless of the IP
address being stored is IPv4 or IPv6, the port number is
*not* stored. We need another column to store it if
required.

We can also store an IPv6 address value. The following
`UPDATE` statement changes the `inetfield` to an
IPv6 address `2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334` , as
shown in the following screenshot:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_07.jpg)

:::
Comparison of the sample row in cqlsh and Cassandra CLI in inetfield
:::

### Note

**Internet Protocol Version 6**

Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the
**Internet Protocol** (**IP**). It was 
developed by the IETF to deal with the
long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion.

IPv6 uses a 128-bit address whereas IPv4 uses 32-bit address. The two
protocols are not designed to be interoperable, making the transition to
IPv6 complicated.

IPv6 addresses are usually represented as eight groups of four
hexadecimal digits separated by colons, such as
`2001:0db8:85a3:0042:1000:8a2e:0370:7334`.

In `cqlsh` , the  leading zeros of each
group of four hexadecimal digits are removed. In
Cassandra's internal storage, the IPv6 address value consumes 16 bytes.


### Int


The `int` data type
is a primitive 32-bit signed integer.


### Text


The `text` data type is a UTF-8 encoded
string accepting Unicode characters. As shown
previously, the byte values of \"`ABC`\", `0x41` ,
`0x42` , and `0x43` , are stored internally. We can
test the `text` field with non-ASCII characters by updating
the `textfield` as shown in the following screenshot:

The `text` data type is a combination of non-ASCII and ASCII
characters. The four non-ASCII characters are represented as their
3-byte UTF-8 values, `0xe8b584` , `0xe6ba90` ,
`0xe68f90` , and `0xe4be9b`.

However, the ASCII characters are still stored as byte values, as shown
in the screenshot:

:::
Experiment of the textfield data type
:::


### Timestamp


The value of the `timestampfield` is encoded as a 64-bit
signed integer representing a number of
milliseconds since the standard base time known as the
*epoch*: January 1, 1970, at 00:00:00 GMT. A
`timestamp` data type can be entered as an
 integer for CQL input, or as a string literal in ISO 8601
formats. As shown in the following screenshot, the internal value of May
1, 2014, 16:02:03, in the +08:00 timezone is
`0x00000145b6cdf878` or 1,398,931,323,000 milliseconds since
the epoch:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_13.jpg)

:::
Experiment of the timestamp data type
:::

A `timestamp` data type contains a date portion and a time
portion in which the time of the day can be omitted
if only the value of the date is wanted. Cassandra 
will use 00:00:00 as the default for the omitted time of day.


### Note

**ISO 8601**

ISO 8601 is the international standard for
representation of dates and times. Its full reference number is ISO
8601:1988 (E), and its title is \"Data elements and interchange formats
-- Information interchange -- Representation of dates and times.\"

ISO 8601 describes a large number of date/time formats depending on the
desired level of granularity. The formats are as follows. Note that the
\"T\" appears literally in the string to indicate the beginning of the
time element.


-   Year: YYYY (e.g. 1997)
-   Year and month: YYYY-MM (e.g. 1997-07)
-   Date: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g. 1997-07-16)
-   Date plus hours and minutes: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (e.g.
    1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)
-   Date plus hours, minutes and seconds: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (e.g.
    1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)
-   Date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal
    fraction of a second: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (e.g.
    1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)


Where:


-   YYYY = four-digit year
-   MM = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
-   DD = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
-   hh = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
-   mm = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
-   ss = two digits of second (00 through 59)
-   s = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
-   TZD = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)


Times are expressed either in **Coordinated
Universal Time** (**UTC**) with a special UTC
designator \"Z\" or in local time together with a time zone offset in
hours and minutes. A time zone offset of \"+/-hh:mm\" indicates the use
of a local time zone which is \"hh\" hours and \"mm\" minutes
ahead/behind of UTC.

If no time zone is specified, the time zone of the
Cassandra coordinator node handing the write
request is used. Therefore the best practice is to specify the time zone
with the timestamp rather than relying on the time zone configured on
the Cassandra nodes to avoid any ambiguities.


### Timeuuid


A value of the `timeuuid` data type is a
Type 1 UUID which includes the time of its
generation and is sorted by timestamp. It is therefore ideal for use in
applications requiring conflict-free timestamps. A valid
`timeuuid` uses the time in 100 intervals since 00:00:00.00
UTC (60 bits), a clock sequence number for prevention of duplicates (14
bits), and the IEEE 801 MAC address (48 bits) to generate a unique
identifier, for example,
`74754ac0-e13f-11e3-a8a3-a92bc9056ee6`.

CQL v3 offers a number of functions to make the manipulation of
`timeuuid` handy:


-   **dateOf()**: This  is used in a
    `SELECT` statement to extract the timestamp portion of a
    `timeuuid` column

-   **now()**: This is used to generate
    a new unique `timeuuid`

-   **minTimeuuid() and maxTimeuuid()**: These are used to
    return a result similar to a UUID given a
    conditional time component as its argument

-   **unixTimestampOf()**: This is used in a
    `SELECT` statement to extract the timestamp
     portion as a raw 64-bit integer timestamp of a
    `timeuuid` column
:::

The following figure uses `timeuuidfield`
of `table01` to demonstrate the usage of
these `timeuuid` functions:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_09.jpg)

:::
Demonstration of timeuuid functions
:::

### Note

**Timestamp or Timeuuid?**

Timestamp is  suitable for storing date and time
values. TimeUUID, however, is more suitable in those cases where a
conflict free, unique timestamp is needed.


### UUID


The `UUID` data type is usually used to
avoid collisions in values. It is a 
16-byte value that accepts a type 1 or type 4 UUID. CQL
v3.1.6 or later versions provide a function called `uuid()` to
easily generate random type 4 UUID values.


### Note

**Type 1 or type 4 UUID?**

Type 1 uses the MAC address of the computer that is generating the
`UUID` data type and the number of
100-nanosecond intervals since the adoption of the Gregorian calendar,
to generate UUIDs. Its uniqueness across computers is guaranteed if MAC
addresses are not duplicated; however, given the speed of modern
processors, successive invocations on the same machine of a naive
implementation of a type 1 generator might produce the same
`UUID` , negating the property of uniqueness.

Type 4 uses random or pseudorandom numbers. Therefore, it is the
recommended type of `UUID` to be used.


### Varchar


Basically `varchar` is  identical to
`text` as evident by the  same
`UTF8Type` in the source code.


### Varint


A `varint` data 
is used to store integers of arbitrary precision.


### Counter


A `counter` data type is a special kind
of column whose user-visible value is a 64-bit
signed integer (though this is more complex internally) used to store a
number that incrementally counts the occurrences of a particular event.
When a new value is written to a given counter column, it is added to
the previous value of the counter.

A counter is ideal for counting things quickly in a distributed
environment which makes it invaluable for real time analytical tasks.
The `counter` data type was introduced in Cassandra Version
0.8. Counter column tables must use `counter` data type.
Counters can be stored in dedicated tables only, and you cannot create
an index on a counter column.


### Tip

**Counter type don'ts**


-   Don't assign the `counter` data type to a column that
    serves as the primary key

-   Don't use the `counter` data type in a table that
    contains anything other than `counter` data types and
    primary keys

-   Don't use the `counter` data type to generate sequential
    numbers for surrogate keys; use the `timeuuid` data type
    instead
:::

We use a `CREATE TABLE` statement to
create a counter table. However, `INSERT` statements are not
allowed on counter tables and so we must use an `UPDATE`
statement to update the counter column as shown in
the following screenshot.

Cassandra uses `counter` instead of `name` to
indicate that the column is of a counter data type. The counter value is
stored in the value of the column.

This is a very good article that explains the internals of how a counter
works in a distributed environment
<http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/whats-new-in-cassandra-2-1-a-better-implementation-of-counters>.

The following screenshot shows that counter value is stored in the value
of the column:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_10.jpg)

:::
Experiment of the counter data type



Collections
-----------------------------



Cassandra also supports collections in its data
model to store a small amount of data. Collections are a complex type
that can provide tremendous flexibility. Three collections are
supported: Set, List, and Map. The type of data stored in each of these
collections requires to be defined, for example, a set of timestamp is
defined as `set<timestamp>` , a list of text is defined as
`list<text>` , a map containing a text key and a text value is
defined as `map<text, text>` , and so on. Also, only native
data types can be used in collections.

Cassandra reads a collection in its entirety and the collection is not
paged internally. The maximum number of items of a collection is 64K and
the maximum size of an item is 64K.

To better demonstrate the CQL support on these collections, let us
create a table in the `fenago` keyspace 
with columns of each collection and insert some data into it,
as shown in the following screenshot:


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fenago/apache-cassandra/master/images/8884OS_03_11.jpg)

:::
Experiment on collections
:::

### Note

**How to update or delete a collection?**

CQL also supports updation and deletion of elements
in a collection. You can refer to the relevant
information in DataStax's documentation at
<http://www.datastax.com/documentation/cql/3.1/cql/cql_using/use_collections_c.html>.

As in the case of native data types, let us walk through each collection
below.



### Set


CQL uses sets to keep a collection of unique
elements. The benefit of a set is that Cassandra
automatically keeps track of the uniqueness of the elements and we, as
application developers, do not need to bother on it.

CQL uses curly braces (`{}`) to represent a set of values
separated by commas. An empty set is simply `{}`. In the
previous example, although we inserted the set as
`{'Lemon', 'Orange', 'Apple'}` , the input order was not
preserved. Why?

The reason is in the mechanism of how Cassandra stores the set.
Internally, Cassandra stores each element of the set as a single column
whose column name is the original column name suffixed by a colon and
the element value. As shown previously, the ASCII values of
`'Apple'` , `'Lemon'` , and `'Orange'` are
`0x4170706c65` , `0x4c656d6f6e` , and
`0x4f72616e6765` , respectively. So they are stored in three
columns with column names, `setfield:4170706c65` ,
`setfield:4c656d6f6e` , and `setfield:4f72616e6765`.
By the built-in order column-name-nature of Cassandra, the elements of a
set are sorted automatically.


### List


A list is ordered by the natural order of the type
selected. Hence it is suitable when uniqueness is
not required and maintaining order is required.

CQL uses square brackets (`[]`) to represent a list of values
separated by commas. An empty list is `[]`. In contrast to a
set, the input order of a list is preserved by Cassandra. Cassandra also
stores each element of the list as a column. But this time, the columns
have the same name composed of the original column name
(`listfield` in our example), a colon, and a
 UUID generated at the time of update. The element value of
the list is stored in the value of the column.


### Map


A map in Cassandra is a dictionary-like data
structure with keys and values. It is useful when
you want to store table-like data within a single Cassandra row.

CQL also uses curly braces (`{}`) to represent a map of keys
and values separated by commas. Each key-value pair is separated by a
colon. An empty map is simply represented as `{}`.
Conceivably, each key/value pair is stored in a column whose column name
is composed of the original map column name followed by a colon and the
key of that pair. The value of the pair is stored in the value of the
column. Similar to a set, the map sorts its items automatically. As a
result, a map can be imagined as a hybrid of a set and a list.



User-defined type and tuple type
--------------------------------


Cassandra 2.1 introduces support for **User-Defined Types**
(**UDT**) and tuple types.

User-defined types are declared at the keyspace
level. A user-defined type simplifies handling a
group of related properties. We can define a group of related properties
as a type and access them separately or as a single entity. We can map
our UDTs to application entities. Another new type for CQL introduced by
Cassandra 2.1 is the tuple type. A tuple is a fixed-length set of typed
positional fields without labels.

We can use user-defined and tuple types in tables. However, to support
future capabilities, a column definition of a user-defined or tuple type
requires the `frozen` keyword. Cassandra serializes a frozen
value having multiple components into a single value. This means we
cannot update parts of a UDT value. The entire value must be
overwritten. Cassandra treats the value of a frozen UDT like a
`BLOB`.

We create a UDT called `contact` in the `fenago`
keyspace and use it to define `contactfield` in
`table04`. Moreover, we have another column,
`tuplefield` , to store a tuple in a row. Pay attention to the
syntax of the `INSERT` statement for UDT and tuple. For UDT,
we may use a dotted notation to retrieve a component of the UDT column,
such as `contactfield.facebook` in our following example. As
shown in `cassandra-cli` , `contactfield` is stored
as a single value,
`00000001620000000163000000076440642e636f6d`.

The value concatenates each UDT component in sequence with the format, a
length of 4 bytes indicating the length of the component value and the
component value itself. So, for `contactfield.facebook` ,
`0x00000001` is the  length and
`0x62` is the byte value of `'a'`. Cassandra
applies the same treatment to a tuple:

Summary
-------------------------



This lab is the second part of Cassandra data modeling. We have
learned the basics of Cassandra Query Language (CQL), which offers a
SQL-like language to implement a Cassandra data model and operate the
data inside. Then a very detailed walkthrough, with ample examples of
native data types, more advanced collections, and new user-defined and
tuple types, was provided to help you know how to select appropriate
data types for your data models. The internal storage of each data type
was also explained to let you know how Cassandra implements its data
types.

In the next lab, we will learn another important element of a
Cassandra query indexes.
