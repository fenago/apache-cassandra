Collection Types

### In this section, you will do the following things:

- Investigate `SET`, which is one of the collection types

- Insert and retrieve rows in the `videos` table that use `SET`


#### The `videos` table uses a `SET` collection to keep track of tags associated with each video. A `SET` is a great collection to use because sets do not maintain an order - we are not concerned with any tag order, only if a tag is or is not associated with the video.

#### Let's start by reviewing the definition of the `videos` table:


**Step 1:**Execute the following cell to describe the `videos` table.




// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)

DESCRIBE TABLE killrvideo.videos;









#### Note two things about the `videos` table. First, the primary key is just `videoid`. Second, the `tags` column is a set of text. Tags are words or phrases we want to associate with a video.

#### To allow us to keep our focus on `SET`, in this example we will only specify the `videoid` and the `tags`. Once again, let's use our contrived `uuid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.


**Step 2:** In the following cell, insert a sparse row into the videos table with a `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212` and a set of tags that contain the words: `Favorite`, `Fast-paced`, `Funny`.


*Need a hint? Click here.*

You want to `INSERT` into the `killrvideo.videos` table with a
`videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212` and a set of tags
such as `{ 'Favorite', 'Fast-paced', 'Funny' }`. \

*Want the command? Click here.*

    INSERT INTO killrvideo.videos (videoid, tags)
      VALUES(12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212, { 'Favorite', 'Fast-paced', 'Funny' });



// Write a command to insert a row into the videos table

// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)









#### Now, let's check to see if our insert worked as expected.


**Step 3:** Execute the following cell to query for the row with the `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.




// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)

SELECT  FROM killrvideo.videos WHERE videoid =










#### Inspect the `tags` values and see that the `INSERT` worked as expected.


#### There are two kinds of `SET` updates we could perform. We can completely replace a set, or we can modify the contents of an existing set. First, we'll replace the entire `tags` set with the values `High-brow`, `Intellectual` and `Refined`.


**Step 4:** In the following cell, write a comand to replace the `tags` set for the `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.


*Need a hint? Click here.*

You want to `UPDATE` the `killrvideo.videos` table with a `videoid` of
`12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`. `SET` the `tags` value to the
new set `{ 'High-brow', 'Intellectual', 'Refined' }`. \

*Want the command? Click here.*

    UPDATE killrvideo.videos SET tags = { 'High-brow', 'Intellectual', 'Refined' } WHERE videoid = 12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212;



// Write a command to update the row from the videos table

// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)









#### Once again, let's inspect the effect of the `UPDATE`.


**Step 5:** Execute the following cell - a query to retrieve the row for the `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.




// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)

SELECT  FROM killrvideo.videos WHERE videoid =










#### We see the values we updated in Step 3. The values may not be in the same order as in your `UPDATE` command, but that's OK.


**Thought question:** If you *were* concerned about the order of the tags, what data type would you use instead of a `SET`?


#### Let's modify the set again. This time we will remove the `Refined` tag. Then in later steps we will replace it with `Low-rent`.


**Step 6:** In the following cell, write a command to update, by removing the `Refined` tag, for the `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.


*Need a hint? Click here.*

Here, you will use an `UPDATE` command. Again, we are updating the row
in the `killrvideo.videos` table with the `videoid` of
`12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`. The clause you use to remove
the tag looks like `tags = tags - { 'Refined' }`. \

*Want the command? Click here.*

    UPDATE killrvideo.videos SET tags = tags - { 'Refined' } WHERE videoid = 12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212;



// Write a command to update the row from the videos table

// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)









#### Again, let's check the contents of the row to see the effects of our command.


**Step 7:** Execute the following cell - a query to retrieve the row for the `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.




// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)

SELECT  FROM killrvideo.videos WHERE videoid =










#### Inspecting the previous results, we see the row now only has two tags - that's what we wanted!


#### Let's add a third tag `Low-rent`.


**Step 8:** In the following cell, write a command to update, by adding the `Low-rent` tag, for the `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.


*Need a hint? Click here.*

Here, you will use an `UPDATE` command. Again, we are updating the row
in the `killrvideo.videos` table with the `videoid` of
`12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`. The clause you use to remove
the tag looks like `tags = tags + { 'Low-rent' }`. \

*Want the command? Click here.*

    UPDATE killrvideo.videos SET tags = tags + { 'Low-rent' } WHERE videoid = 12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212;



// Write a command to update the row from the videos table

// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)









#### One last time, let's check the contents of the row to see the effects of our command.


**Step 9:** Execute the following cell.




// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)

SELECT  FROM killrvideo.videos WHERE videoid =










#### Review the results in the previous cell to see that the update worked as expected.

* * * * *

**Note (some things to keep in mind about Collections):**\

To avoid performance problems, only use collections for small-ish
numbers of elements
Sets and maps do not incur the read-before-write penalty, but some
list operations do. Therefore, when possible, prefer sets to lists
List prepend and append operations are not idempotent, so retrying
after a timeout may result in duplicate elements
Collections may only be used in primary keys if they are frozen

Counters

### In this section, you will do the following things:

- Investigate the `video_playback_stats` table in `killrvideo`

- Add a row to the `video_playback_stats` table

- Increment the counter of the table to simulate videoing a video


#### KillrVideo uses the `video_playback_stats` table to keep track of the number of times a video has been viewed. A counter is a great data type for this use-case because counters perform well in Cassandra, and in the rare event where the counter might drop an update, it is not a serious problem for the app or its users.


#### Let's start by investigating this table.


**Step 1:** In the following cell, describe the `video_playback_stats` table.

*Need a hint? Click here.*

You want to use the `DESCRIBE` command to describe only the table. \

*Want the command? Click here.*

    DESCRIBE TABLE killrvideo.video_playback_stats;



// Write a command to allow you to review the table definition for
video\_playback\_stats

// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)









#### Notice that this table has two columns: `videoid` and `views`. Also, notice that `views` is a counter that keeps track of how many times the video has been, uh, viewed.

#### In this section, we want to update a counter. Just to keep things simple, let's use a contrived `uuid` for the `videoid`. We'll use the value `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.


#### We'll start by verifying that a row for this `videoid` does not yet exist in the table.


**Step 2:** In the following cell, try to retrieve the row with the `videoid` of `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.

*Need a hint? Click here.*

For this command, you will use the `SELECT` statement on the
`video_playback_stats` table in the `killrvideo` keyspace. You only
want the row where the `videoid` is
`12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`, but it will be easiest just to
grab all the columns. \

*Want the command? Click here.*

    SELECT * from killrvideo.video_playback_stats WHERE videoid = 12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212;



// Write a command to try to retrieve the row with a videoid of


// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)









#### We see “No Data Returned” which allows us to verify that the row with that key is not in the table yet.

#### Let's try creating the row with that `videoid`.


**Step 3:** Create the row by incrementing the `views` counter for the `videoid` `12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`.

*Need a hint? Click here.*

You will be `UPDATE`ing the row in the
`killrvideo.video_playback_stats` with the `videoid` of
`12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212`. You will increment the counter
with code like this: `views = views + 1`. \

*Want the command? Click here.*

    UPDATE killrvideo.video_playback_stats SET views = views + 1 WHERE videoid = 12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212;

**Thought question:** Since we know we cannot `INSERT` a row with a counter, we can only `UPDATE` the row, what will the value of the counter be after we increment it?




// Write a command to update the views counter of the row with a videoid
of 12121212-1212-1212-1212-121212121212

// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)









#### Let's see the results of the update!


**Step 4:** Execute the following cell and inspect the results.




// Execute this cell (click the Run button in the top-right corner)

SELECT  FROM killrvideo.video\_playback\_stats WHERE videoid =










#### This time we see the row. We created the row with the `UPDATE` command - an upsert! Notice that the value of the `views` counter is one. That's because, when you create a row by incrementing the counter, it's as if the counter started at zero.

* * * * *

**Note (some things to keep in mind about counters):**\

Counters cannot be part of a primary key
Incrementing or decrementing counters is not idempotent
Incrementing or decrementing a counter is not always guaranteed to
work - under high traffic situations, it is possible for one of these
operations to get dropped

Bonus Challenge: Create a UDT

If you got done early and want something to do while you wait for
others, here's a bonus challenge

### In this section, you will do the following things:

- Create a UDT to represent video encoding

- Alter the KillrVideo `videos` table to use this UDT

- Load some data into the altered `videos` table

- Run a query on the loaded data with the UDT

- Update the value of a row containing a UDT

**Here's the pitch:**

#### As KillrVideo grows in popularity, it becomes necessary to support various video formats with different bit rates, encodings and frame sizes. This seems like an ideal use for a UDT. Let's build the UDT and then add it to the `videos` table.

**Step 1:** In the next cell, write and execute the CQL to create a UDT, named `video_encoding` that contains the fields as described in the following table.

Field Name

Data Type

bit\_rates

SET\<TEXT\

encoding

TEXT

height

INT

width

INT

*Want the solution? Click here.*

    CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS killrvideo.video_encoding (
        bit_rates   SET<TEXT,
        encoding    TEXT,
        height      INT,
        width       INT
    );



// Create the video\_encoding UDT in this cell as described.

// Then, to execute this cell, click the Run button in the top-right
corner (or SHIFT-ENTER)









**Step 2:** In the next cell, truncate the contents of the `videos` table to prepare it to receive the data with the encoding.

*Want the solution? Click here.*

    TRUNCATE TABLE killrvideo.videos;



// Write the CQL to truncate the videos table

// Then, to execute this cell, click the Run button in the top-right
corner (or SHIFT-ENTER)









**Step 3:** In the next cell, alter the `videos` table by adding an `encodings` column of type `FROZEN<video_encoding`.

* * * * *

**NOTE:** UDTs that contain containers (e.g., sets, lists, etc.) must be declared `FROZEN` to make it explicit that Cassandra serializes the contents of the UDT into a single value for storage.

* * * * *

*Want the solution? Click here.*

    ALTER TABLE killrvideo.videos ADD (encoding FROZEN<video_encoding);



// Write the CQL to add the encoding column to the videos table

// Then, to execute this cell, click the Run button in the top-right
corner (or SHIFT-ENTER)









**Step 4:** Use the `COPY` command in *cqlsh* to populate the `videos` table from the contents of the `/home/ubuntu/data/videos.csv` file.

- To complete this step, you must have already completed the bonus challenge in *Notebook 2: Using CQL*, which setups up the *cqlsh* connection.

- In Theia, open `/home/ubuntu/data/videos.csv` to make note of the columns in the file. Since the file does not contain all the columns in the table, you will need to list these in the `COPY` command. The form of the command looks like `COPY keyspacename.tablename (col1,col2,col3) FROM filename.csv WITH HEADER=TRUE;`

- While still in the `videos.csv` file, you may find it helpful to also note the format of the values for the `video_encoding` UDT.

- Open a terminal window in Theia

- Be sure to `cd ~/.cassandra`

- Launch *cqlsh* by `cqlsh -u KVUser -p KVPassword`

- Remember to set the consistency level by `CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM;`

- `COPY` the `/home/ubuntu/data/videos.csv` file into the `videos` table.

*Want the solution? Click here.*

    COPY killrvideo.videos (videoid,added_date,description,tags,name,userid) FROM '/home/ubuntu/data/videos.csv' WITH HEADER=TRUE;







**Step 5:** Use the `COPY` command in *cqlsh* also to encodings to the `videos` table from the contents of the `/home/ubuntu/data/videos_encoding.csv` file.

- Again, in Theia open the file (`/home/ubuntu/data/videos_encoding`) to make note of the columns the file contains.

- Back in *cqlsh* `COPY` the `/home/ubuntu/data/videos_encodings.csv` file into the `videos` table.

*Want the solution? Click here.*

    COPY killrvideo.videos (videoid,encoding) FROM '/home/ubuntu/data/videos_encoding.csv' WITH HEADER=TRUE;







**Step 6:** In the following cell, query the `videos` table for the `encoding` column value of the row with the `videoid` of `2644c36e-14bd-11e5-839e-8438355b7e3a`.

- Inspect the output to see what the UDT looks like.

*Want the solution? Click here.*

    SELECT encoding FROM killrvideo.videos WHERE videoid=2644c36e-14bd-11e5-839e-8438355b7e3a;



// Write a CQL query to find the row in the videos table with a videoid
of 2644c36e-14bd-11e5-839e-8438355b7e3a

// Then, to execute this cell, click the Run button in the top-right
corner (or SHIFT-ENTER)









#### The UDT is `FROZEN` which means if you want to update it, you must replace the entire contents of the UDT. Remember, Cassandra encodes the UDT into something like a single blob.

**Step 7:** In the following cell, write a CQL UPDATE command to add a bit rate of “1500 Kbps” to the `video_encoding` for the row with the `videoid` of `2644c36e-14bd-11e5-839e-8438355b7e3a`.

- Here is an example of the correct format of the UDT *before* the update of the additional bit rate.

<!-- --

    {
        encoding: '1080p',
        height: 1080,
        width: 1920,
        bit_rates: {
            '3000 Kbps', 
            '4500 Kbps', 
            '6000 Kbps'
        }
    }

*Want the solution? Click here.*

    UPDATE killrvideo.videos
        SET encoding={encoding: '1080p', height: 1080, width: 1920, bit_rates: {'1500 Kbps', '3000 Kbps', '4500 Kbps', '6000 Kbps'}}
        WHERE videoid=2644c36e-14bd-11e5-839e-8438355b7e3a;



// Write a CQL update command to add a bit\_rate of 1500 Kbps to the row
in the videos table with a videoid of


// Then, to execute this cell, click the Run button in the top-right
corner (or SHIFT-ENTER)
